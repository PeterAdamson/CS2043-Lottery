# CS2043-Lottery
Simulates a lottery where a variety of tickets are created and added to a draw. The draw is then run and the winning numbers along with winning tickets are reported.  Any winning tickets are reported with their numbers along with the number of matches to the winning numbers. If a ticket is created with no arguments the numbers are randomly generated.  Otherwise, a ticket can be created by explicitly providing 5 integers or an array of 5 integers. If more or less than 5 numbers are provided in an array, the system will notify that an incorrect number of numbers has been specified, then exit.  If duplicate numbers are specified on ticket creating, the system will notify that invalid numbers have been specified, then exit.
